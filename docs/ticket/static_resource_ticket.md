# Static Resource Organization and Copy Ticket

This document outlines the plan for organizing and copying static resources from the legacy YSFLIGHT system to the new web-based environment.

---

## 1. Overview

The YSFLIGHT system relies on various static assets such as images, runtime configuration files, and other resources that must be preserved or adapted for web deployment. This ticket details the steps to:

- Identify and catalog necessary static assets.
- Organize resources in a structure optimized for web delivery.
- Copy files from the legacy `/YSFLIGHT/` directory to the appropriate locations in the new project.
- Ensure resource paths and formats are compatible with web technologies.

---

## 2. Objectives

- **Catalog Assets:**  
  - Review directories such as `bitmap/`, `runtime/`, and any other resource folders (e.g., `testscenery/`).
  - Document the types of files (images, configuration files, etc.) and their usage.

- **Organize Structure:**  
  - Define a clear directory structure for web resources.
  - Map legacy resource paths to their new locations.

- **Copy and Adapt:**  
  - Develop scripts or procedures to copy assets directly.
  - Evaluate if any assets (e.g., image formats) require conversion or optimization for web use.

- **Validation:**  
  - Create simple tests to verify that resources load correctly in the browser.
  - Ensure that all necessary files are accessible post-deployment.

## 3. Detailed Task Breakdown

### 3.1 Asset Cataloging
- **Task 1:** List all directories and files under `/YSFLIGHT/` that pertain to static resources (e.g., `bitmap/`, `runtime/`, etc.).
- **Task 2:** Document each assetâ€™s purpose and any dependencies in a resource inventory file.

### 3.2 Structure Definition
- **Task 1:** Define a new directory hierarchy for static assets in the web project (e.g., `public/assets/` with subdirectories for images, configurations, etc.).
- **Task 2:** Create a mapping document that outlines the old paths versus new paths.

### 3.3 Copying and Adaptation
- **Task 1:** Implement or specify copy procedures (scripts or manual processes) to transfer files from `/YSFLIGHT/` to the new structure.
- **Task 2:** Identify if any file conversions are necessary (e.g., image optimizations, format changes).
- **Task 3:** Validate integrity and accessibility of copied resources.

### 3.4 Testing and Verification
- **Task 1:** Develop simple tests (e.g., HTML or JavaScript test pages) to ensure that copied assets can be loaded in a browser.
- **Task 2:** Document any issues and resolution steps.

## 4. Dependencies and Integration

- The resource organization ticket depends on having a complete list of assets from the legacy system.
- Coordination with other tickets, particularly input/output handling in various modules, is required to update resource paths in the code.

---

## 5. Next Steps

1. Finalize the asset catalog and structure mapping.
2. Execute copy operations with validation tests.
3. Integrate feedback from testing, and update resource paths in code if necessary.
4. Document the process for future reference.

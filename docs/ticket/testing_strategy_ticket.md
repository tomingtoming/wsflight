# Testing Strategy and Commit Protocol Ticket

This document outlines the approach for implementing an effective testing strategy and a commit protocol for the YSFLIGHT migration project. The objective is to ensure that each component’s functionality is validated thoroughly before integration, and that commits are made only after all tests pass.

---

## 1. Overview

- **Testing Strategy:**  
  Develop unit tests and integration tests for each migrated module using Deno’s testing framework (or equivalent). These tests will validate the translated logic against expected behavior from the legacy system.
  
- **Commit Protocol:**  
  A commit is to be made only after all the corresponding tests for a module or fix have successfully passed. This ensures a stable codebase and makes future debugging easier.

## 2. Testing Strategy

### 2.1 Unit Testing
- **Scope:**  
  - Test individual functions and classes within each module.
  - Verify that each translated function returns the expected result with various input combinations.
  
- **Tools:**  
  - Use Deno’s built-in testing framework.
  
- **Implementation Guidelines:**  
  - Write tests in a dedicated `/tests/` directory, mirroring the component structure.
  - Ensure comprehensive coverage of edge cases and boundary conditions.

### 2.2 Integration Testing
- **Scope:**  
  - Test interaction between modules to ensure that data flows correctly.
  - Validate that event handling and resource loading work as expected in the integrated environment.
  
- **Tools:**  
  - Use Deno alongside simulated DOM event libraries if needed for testing input events.
  
- **Implementation Guidelines:**  
  - Create test pages or scripts for simulating real user interactions.
  - Validate that UI, input, and backend logic connect seamlessly.

### 2.3 Performance and Regression Testing
- **Scope:**  
  - Basic performance test for critical functions to ensure compatibility with the web environment.
  - Regression tests to ensure that newly added tests capture the legacy behavior accurately.

## 3. Commit Protocol

### 3.1 Commit Conditions
- **Unit and Integration Tests:**  
  - No commit should be made unless all tests related to the specific change pass.
  
- **Automated CI/CD:**  
  - Integrate with a CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically before merge.
  
- **Documentation:**  
  - Each commit must be accompanied by updated test results and any relevant documentation changes.

### 3.2 Commit Guidelines
- Commit messages should clearly define:
  - The specific component or module affected.
  - The purpose of the commit.
  - Reference to the associated ticket or task.
- Ensure that commit messages follow a consistent format for easier tracking and rollback if necessary.

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Develop Test Suites:**  
   - Begin with unit tests for individual modules based on the migration rules.
   - Set up integration tests for the interactions between modules.
   
2. **CI/CD Integration:**  
   - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to enforce commit protocol by running tests automatically.
   
3. **Documentation Updates:**  
   - Continuously update test documentation to include new test cases and results.
   
4. **Monitoring and Feedback:**  
   - Establish a mechanism for monitoring test coverage and receiving feedback from developers.

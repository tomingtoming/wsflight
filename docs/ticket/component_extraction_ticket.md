# Component Extraction and Task Breakdown

This document details the plan for extracting core components from the legacy YSFLIGHT system and preparing them for translation to TypeScript. This ticket is intended to guide subsequent development work and to enable delegation to other team members if necessary.

---

## 1. Overview

The legacy YSFLIGHT simulator is structured into several modules which handle distinct functionalities. The primary objective is to identify these modules and define clear translation rules for migrating C++ code to TypeScript while preserving functionality. The process also involves designing tests for every migrated component.

## 2. Core Modules to Extract

The following core modules have been identified:

- **Graphics**  
  - Directory: `YSFLIGHT/src/graphics/`  
  - Responsibilities: Rendering, 2D/3D visual elements, scene management.
  
- **Dynamics/Physics**  
  - Directory: `YSFLIGHT/src/dynamics/`  
  - Responsibilities: Physics simulation, motion calculations, collision detection.
  
- **GUI**  
  - Directory: `YSFLIGHT/src/gui/`  
  - Responsibilities: User interfaces, control panels, display overlays.
  
- **Autopilot/Control**  
  - Directory: `YSFLIGHT/src/autopilot/`  
  - Responsibilities: Automated flight control logic, decision-making algorithms.
  
- **Input Handling**  
  - Spread across various directories (e.g., `YSFLIGHT/src/`, `YSFLIGHT/ysjoystick/`)  
  - Responsibilities: Keyboard and mouse input capturing, event translation, remapping for web compatibility.

## 3. Migration Rules

For each module, the following guidelines will be applied:

- **Language Transition**  
  - Translate C++ constructs to equivalent TypeScript patterns.
  - Preserve business logic, algorithms, and performance considerations.
  
- **Structure and Modularity**  
  - Maintain modular boundaries to ensure that each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.
  - Leverage ES modules for clean import/export of functionalities.
  
- **Testing Strategy**  
  - Develop unit tests using Denoâ€™s testing framework.
  - Each module must have a corresponding suite of tests that verify expected behavior.
  - Integration tests will verify that modules interact correctly.
  
- **Documentation**  
  - All code will be documented in English.
  - Documents will include translation rules and any necessary annotations regarding legacy behavior versus new implementation.
  
- **Resource Adaptation**  
  - Identify dependencies on static assets or runtime configurations.
  - Ensure that resource paths and usage are updated for a web-based environment.

## 4. Detailed Task Breakdown

For each core module, the following tasks need to be completed:

### 4.1 Graphics Module
- **Task 1:** Review and document class structures and dependencies.
- **Task 2:** Define translation guidelines for rendering pipelines to three.js.
- **Task 3:** Create TypeScript prototypes and corresponding tests.

### 4.2 Dynamics/Physics Module
- **Task 1:** Analyze simulation algorithms and numeric methods.
- **Task 2:** Map physics calculations to JavaScript/TypeScript equivalents.
- **Task 3:** Establish rigorous test cases to ensure simulation accuracy.

### 4.3 GUI Module
- **Task 1:** Inventory UI components and their interactions.
- **Task 2:** Define strategies to port native UI elements to a web framework.
- **Task 3:** Develop component tests for user interaction flows.

### 4.4 Autopilot/Control Module
- **Task 1:** Extract flight control logic and autopilot routines.
- **Task 2:** Identify critical decision-making points and state transitions.
- **Task 3:** Create mapping rules and tests for behavioral consistency.

### 4.5 Input Handling Module
- **Task 1:** Catalog all input method references and event handling routines.
- **Task 2:** Specify mapping adjustments (e.g., remapping TAB to a web-friendly key).
- **Task 3:** Build test cases to validate input event translation in a browser environment.

---

## 5. Dependencies and Integration

- **Inter-Module Communication:**  
  Clearly define interfaces between modules to ensure that the translation does not break internal contracts.
  
- **Resource Management:**  
  Verify that all modules correctly reference and load necessary static assets.
  
- **Testing Integration:**  
  Modules must implement both unit and integration tests. Testing suites will be part of the CI/CD pipeline.

---

## 6. Next Steps

1. Finalize architectural diagrams and detailed translation maps for each module.
2. Begin allocation of tasks to team members with detailed tickets per module.
3. Schedule review sessions as modules are translated to ensure adherence to migration rules.
4. Integrate tests continuously and commit after passing all tests.

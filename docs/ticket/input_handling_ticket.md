# Keyboard and Mouse Input Mimicry Ticket

This document details the plan for replicating the keyboard and mouse input
behavior from the legacy YSFLIGHT system in the new web-based simulator.

---

## 1. Overview

The original YSFLIGHT simulator handles keyboard and mouse inputs natively in
C++. For the web-based version, we need:

- To capture keyboard and mouse events using browser APIs.
- To remap keys that are unsuitable for a web environment (e.g., TAB) to
  alternative keys.
- To ensure similar responsiveness and behavior as the legacy system.
- To develop thorough tests validating that input behavior is preserved.

---

## 2. Objectives

- **Event Capturing:**\
  Leverage browser event listeners (`keydown`, `keyup`, `mousemove`, etc.) to
  capture input events.

- **Key Remapping:**\
  Identify keys that are problematic in a browser context. Provide remapping
  guidelines (e.g., mapping TAB to another key) and configuration options for
  future adjustments.

- **Behavioral Consistency:**\
  Ensure that the translated input handling logic mirrors the legacy behavior,
  including support for simultaneous key presses and correct event propagation.

- **Testing:**\
  Develop tests to simulate user interactions and verify that:
  - Input events are correctly captured.
  - Key remappings work as intended.
  - Mouse events reflect accurate cursor positions and actions.

## 3. Detailed Task Breakdown

### 3.1 Analysis and Documentation

- **Task 1:** Review legacy input handling code (e.g., in
  `/YSFLIGHT/ysjoystick/` and relevant sections in `/YSFLIGHT/src/`) to document
  existing behavior.
- **Task 2:** Identify specific keys that require remapping for browser
  compatibility.

### 3.2 Implementation Guidelines

- **Task 1:** Define how to structure input event handlers in TypeScript.
  - Utilize modern event listener patterns.
  - Use appropriate abstraction layers to separate input capture from game
    logic.
- **Task 2:** Implement configuration for key remapping.
  - Provide default mappings with documentation for customization.

### 3.3 Testing Strategy

- **Task 1:** Develop unit tests for individual event handlers using Denoâ€™s
  testing framework.
- **Task 2:** Create integration tests (e.g., using simulated DOM events) to
  validate overall input behavior.
- **Task 3:** Verify that altered mappings deliver the same expected outcomes as
  in the legacy system.

---

## 4. Dependencies and Integration

- **Interface Design:**\
  Ensure that the input module interfaces seamlessly with other components such
  as the GUI and autopilot modules.

- **Documentation Updates:**\
  Update developer documentation with remapping guidelines and testing results.

- **Coordination:**\
  Collaborate with teams handling Graphics and Autopilot modules to confirm that
  input events correctly trigger the associated actions.

---

## 5. Next Steps

1. Finalize the detailed mapping of legacy input events to web-compatible
   events.
2. Implement the input handling module in TypeScript with included remapping
   configurations.
3. Develop and integrate comprehensive tests.
4. Document any deviations or new behaviors introduced in the web environment.
